SDL REVERSI TODO LIST

- implement a checking mechanism which reports the score at the end of
	the game

- improve the colors. 

- tighten up the error checking, so that faulty moves aren't made.

- Add endgame logic to the AI

- Add defensive analysis to the AI.  such as, dont give up the corner.

- fix the display so that it can be re-sized and toggled to and from
fullscreen.   

- add some sprites so that the UI will look right, such as a little 
menu when it first boots up, that can be navigated with arrow keys.
choose 0, 1, or 2 players, level of difficult easy, medium, hard, really hard

- piece flip animation

- improve the graphic a little to made the pieces look slightly 3D, 
	you know, see them as cylindrical slices like from the 
	classic parker bros. Othello.

- add SDL_flip to the AI algorithm so that once in awhile the screen redraws,
	in case of a move or something
